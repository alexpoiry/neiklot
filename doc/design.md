## Introduction

Neiklot mutates and/or creates languages.

### Description

Neiklot is a program that operates on a list of words. It either mutates the individual items in the list or the list itself.
It has pluggable architecture to allow more and more advanced operations on the word list to more closely imitate the known methods of language mutation and genesis.
